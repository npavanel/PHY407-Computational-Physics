# PHY407-Computational-Physics
This repository will hold all lab work for PHY407, allowing for easy collaboration.


Topics covered by myself are as follows:

Lab 1: Numerical Solutions for Planetary Orbits & Speed Tests: Loops vs Linear Algebra Libraries
Lab 2: Numerical Error, Numerical Integration, and Simulated Diffraction Patterns
Lab 3: Classical and Quantum Oscillators, and Elevation Maps with Gradients
Lab 4: Numerical Solutinos to Non-linear Equations
Lab 5: Applications of Fourier Transforms: The Sunspot Cycle and Dow Jones Data
Lab 6: Orbiting Space Junk with the 4th Order Runge-Kutta (RK4) Method
Lab 7: Fixed and Adaptive RK4, ODEs with the Bulirsch-Stoer Method
Lab 8: PDEs: 1D Tsunami Simulations with the Lax-Wendoff Scheme
Lab 9: Electric and Magnetic Fields with Fourier Transforms and the Crank-Nicolson Procedure
Lab 10: Diffusion Limited Agrregation and Brownian Walks
Lab 11: Optimization with Simulated Annealing and Monte Carlo Methods

Final Project: Probing the Stability of Planar Circumbinary Planetary Orbits with RK4
